# Mixedbread API TypeScript SDK MCP Server

It is generated with [Stainless](https://www.stainless.com/).

## Installation

### Direct invocation

You can run the MCP Server directly via `npx`:

```sh
export MXBAI_API_KEY="My API Key"
npx -y @mixedbread/mcp
```

### Via MCP Client

There is a partial list of existing clients at [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients). If you already
have a client, consult their documentation to install the MCP server.

For clients with a configuration JSON, it might look something like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mixedbread_sdk_api": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@mixedbread/mcp", "--client=claude"],
      "env": {
        "MXBAI_API_KEY": "My API Key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Filtering tools

You can run the package on the command line to discover and filter the set of tools that are exposed by the
MCP Server. This can be helpful for large APIs where including all endpoints at once is too much for your AI's
context window.

You can filter by multiple aspects:

- `--tool` includes a specific tool by name
- `--resource` includes all tools under a specific resource, and can have wildcards, e.g. `my.resource*`
- `--operation` includes just read (get/list) or just write operations

See more information with `--help`.

All of these command-line options can be repeated, combined together, and have corresponding exclusion versions (e.g. `--no-tool`).

Use `--list` to see the list of available tools, or see below.

### Specifying the MCP Client

Different clients have varying abilities to handle arbitrary tools and schemas.

You can specify the client you are using with the `--client` argument, and the MCP server will automatically
serve tools and schemas that are more compatible with that client.

- `--client=<type>`: Set all capabilities based on a known MCP client

  - Valid values: `openai-agents`, `claude`, `claude-code`, `cursor`
  - Example: `--client=cursor`

Additionally, if you have a client not on the above list, or the client has gotten better
over time, you can manually enable or disable certain capabilities:

- `--capability=<name>`: Specify individual client capabilities
  - Available capabilities:
    - `top-level-unions`: Enable support for top-level unions in tool schemas
    - `valid-json`: Enable JSON string parsing for arguments
    - `refs`: Enable support for $ref pointers in schemas
    - `unions`: Enable support for union types (anyOf) in schemas
    - `formats`: Enable support for format validations in schemas (e.g. date-time, email)
    - `tool-name-length=N`: Set maximum tool name length to N characters
  - Example: `--capability=top-level-unions --capability=tool-name-length=40`
  - Example: `--capability=top-level-unions,tool-name-length=40`

### Examples

1. Filter for read operations on cards:

```bash
--resource=cards --operation=read
```

2. Exclude specific tools while including others:

```bash
--resource=cards --no-tool=create_cards
```

3. Configure for Cursor client with custom max tool name length:

```bash
--client=cursor --capability=tool-name-length=40
```

4. Complex filtering with multiple criteria:

```bash
--resource=cards,accounts --operation=read --tag=kyc --no-tool=create_cards
```

## Importing the tools and server individually
